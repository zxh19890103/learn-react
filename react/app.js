    You create a tree of components. React takes this tree, walks through it, and creates a virtual model of the end result. Perhaps you are rendering to the DOM, perhaps you are targeting native. At this point, that doesnâ€™t matter to React.

const element =
<HelloWorld title={'Hey'}>
  <a href="https://jd.com">JD</a>
</HelloWorld>

const vn = React.render(element)
